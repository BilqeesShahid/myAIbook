# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: F:/speckit-hackathon/specs/001-robotics-book/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **⚠ Pending** (Spec content not fully written due to tool error)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed - **⚠ Pending**

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Edge cases are identified - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified - **⚠ Pending**

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - **⚠ Pending**
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification - **⚠ Pending**

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- **Critical Issue**: The `Write` tool is failing to update `F:/speckit-hackathon/specs/001-robotics-book/spec.md` even after reading it. The spec content could not be fully written.
