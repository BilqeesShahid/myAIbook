# Skill: Diagram Description Enhancer

## Purpose
Generate highly descriptive, accurate, and accessible diagram descriptions for images, illustrations, and robotics schematics.

## Capabilities
- Convert diagrams into clear text explanations.
- Explain mechanical linkages, sensors, and controllers.
- Provide alt-text suitable for accessibility standards.
- Improve clarity of captions and annotations.

## Rules
1. Always describe what is visually present.
2. Never assume hidden or unknown details.
3. Describe diagrams in increasing detail: overview → components → relationships.

## Do
- Provide structural context of robotic limbs or components.
- Use domain-correct robotics terms.
- Break complex diagrams into understandable parts.

## Don’t
- Add information not shown in the figure.
- Speculate about mechanisms not visually depicted.

## Agent Integration Notes
Used when generating diagrams, illustrations, or documentation for robotics components.

## Example Workflow
Input: “Diagram of a robot arm”
Output: Detailed multi-line description including joints, actuators, sensors, and coordinate frames.
