# Skill: Robotics Terminology Guardian

## Purpose
Ensure that all content related to Physical AI, humanoid robotics, actuators, sensors, motion planning, and controller design uses accurate, consistent, and domain-correct terminology. Maintain engineering standards in all text generated by agents.

## Capabilities
- Validate robotics engineering vocabulary, symbols, notations, and acronyms.
- Correct misuse of mechanical, electrical, or control systems terminology.
- Ensure consistent naming across chapters (e.g., torque vs moment, joint angle vs DOF).
- Detect and fix imprecise technical language or vague robotics concepts.
- Expand shorthand terms into full explanations when needed.

## Rules
1. Always apply IEEE robotics and AI vocabulary conventions.
2. Prefer precision over simplicity unless the agent task specifies otherwise.
3. Correct any ambiguous robotics phrase and offer a clearer alternative.
4. Translate mechanical formulas into standardized notation (q, τ, Kp, Ki, Kd, etc.).
5. Do not invent new robotics terms unless logically derived and explained.

## Do
- Replace fuzzy statements with clear engineering language.
- Ensure index notation is consistent in mathematical expressions.
- Use consistent units (SI) everywhere.

## Don’t
- Offer opinions not grounded in engineering knowledge.
- Change scientific meaning while simplifying.

## Agent Integration Notes
Use this skill before editing, summarizing, or generating training material for robotics sections.

## Example Workflow
Input: “Robots use power to move their joints.”
Output: “A humanoid robot applies actuator torque (τ) to generate joint motion across its kinematic chain.”
