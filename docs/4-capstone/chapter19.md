# Chapter 19: Simulated Environment Setup and Humanoid Model

Before we can implement the autonomous behaviors for our humanoid robot, we need to establish a realistic and functional simulated environment and integrate our humanoid robot model within it. This chapter will guide you through setting up a suitable simulation world and configuring the humanoid robot for interaction.

## Setting Up the Simulated Home Environment

For this capstone, we will either use Gazebo or Isaac Sim as our simulation platform, building upon the knowledge from Module 1. The environment should represent a typical home setting with multiple rooms (e.g., living room, kitchen), furniture, and small objects for manipulation.

### Using Gazebo (Example)

If using Gazebo, you would typically:

1.  **Create a custom `.world` file**: This file (e.g., `~/ros2_ws/src/my_robot_pkg/worlds/home_environment.world`) will define the static elements of your environment, such as walls, floors, furniture (tables, shelves), and light sources. You can use simple primitives or import more complex models from Gazebo's model database or custom assets.

    *Example Snippet (`home_environment.world`)*:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <sdf version="1.6">
      <world name="home_world">
        <include>
          <uri>model://sun</uri>
        </include>
        <include>
          <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
        </include>

        <!-- Example: A simple table -->
        <model name="table">
          <pose>2 0 0.75 0 0 0</pose>
          <static>true</static>
          <link name="table_link">
            <visual name="visual">
              <geometry><box><size>1.0 0.6 0.03</size></box></geometry>
              <material><ambient>0.5 0.5 0.5 1</ambient><diffuse>0.7 0.7 0.7 1</diffuse></material>
            </visual>
            <collision name="collision">
              <geometry><box><size>1.0 0.6 0.03</size></box></geometry>
            </collision>
          </link>
          <link name="leg1">
            <!-- ... leg definition ... -->
          </link>
          <!-- ... other legs ... -->
        </model>

        <!-- You would add more models for walls, other furniture, etc. -->

      </world>
    </sdf>
    ```

2.  **Populate with Objects**: You'll need to add small, interactable objects (e.g., soda cans, books, toys) to the world. These can be simple Gazebo primitives or imported meshes. Make sure they are not static so the robot can manipulate them.

    *Example: Adding a soda can*
    ```xml
    <model name="soda_can">
      <pose>2.5 0.2 0.8 0 0 0</pose>
      <link name="can_link">
        <visual name="visual"><geometry><cylinder><radius>0.03</radius><length>0.12</length></cylinder></geometry></visual>
        <collision name="collision">
          <geometry><cylinder><radius>0.03</radius><length>0.12</length></cylinder></geometry>
        </collision>
        <inertial>
          <mass>0.1</mass>
          <inertia ixx="0.0001" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="0.0001" iyz="0" izz="0.00005"/>
        </inertial>
      </link>
    </model>
    ```

### Using Isaac Sim (Example)

If using Isaac Sim, the process involves building a USD stage:

1.  **Create a New USD Stage**: Start with a new, empty stage in Isaac Sim.
2.  **Import Environment Assets**: Utilize Omniverse's extensive asset library or import custom 3D models (OBJ, FBX) for rooms, furniture, and decorative elements. Arrange them to form your home environment.
3.  **Add Physics and Materials**: Ensure all static environment objects have `Collider` components and appropriate physics materials for realistic interactions.
4.  **Populate with Interactable Objects**: Drag and drop or import small objects that the robot will manipulate. Add `Rigid Body` physics to these objects so they can be affected by the robot.
5.  **Lighting and Cameras**: Configure lighting to ensure good visual fidelity for perception tasks. Add ground-truth cameras for generating synthetic data.

## Humanoid Robot Model Integration

Integrating a complex humanoid robot model is a critical step. For this capstone, we will assume the availability of a pre-existing humanoid URDF/XACRO model (or a USD model for Isaac Sim) that is compatible with ROS2 `ros2_control`.

### Robot Model Requirements

*   **URDF/XACRO (for Gazebo) or USD (for Isaac Sim)**: A complete description of the humanoid's links, joints, inertial properties, visual meshes, and collision meshes.
*   **`ros2_control` Configuration**: The model's description *must* include the `<ros2_control>` tag, specifying the hardware interfaces for each joint (e.g., position, velocity, effort interfaces) and the Gazebo/Isaac Sim plugins that bridge these to the simulator.
*   **Sensors**: The model should include a simulated RGB-D camera (for color images and depth information) and an IMU. These sensors will publish data on ROS2 topics.
*   **End-Effector/Gripper**: A functional gripper model with appropriate joint definitions and control interfaces for grasping objects.

### Spawning the Humanoid Robot

Similar to Chapter 7, we will use a ROS2 launch file to spawn the humanoid robot into our simulated environment.

1.  **`robot_description`**: The humanoid's URDF/XACRO will be processed (e.g., using `xacro`) and published to the `/robot_description` topic by `robot_state_publisher`.
2.  **`ros_gz_sim` (Gazebo) or Isaac Sim Python API**: A ROS2 node (like `ros_gz_sim`'s `create` executable) or a Python script using Isaac Sim's API will be used to inject the humanoid model into the simulation environment.
3.  **Controller Spawners**: Your launch file will also start the `controller_manager` and spawner nodes for all necessary controllers (e.g., `joint_state_broadcaster`, `joint_trajectory_controller` for arms/legs, and specific gripper controllers).

*Example Launch File Snippet (`humanoid_sim_launch.py`)*:

```python
import os
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource
from launch.substitutions import Command
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    # ... (similar path definitions as in chapter 7)
    pkg_name = 'my_robot_pkg'
    humanoid_urdf_path = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory(pkg_name), 'urdf', 'humanoid.xacro')
    world_path = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory(pkg_name), 'worlds', 'home_environment.world')
    controller_config_path = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory(pkg_name), 'config', 'humanoid_controllers.yaml')

    robot_description_content = Command(['xacro ', humanoid_urdf_path])

    robot_state_publisher_node = Node(
        package='robot_state_publisher',
        executable='robot_state_publisher',
        parameters=[{'robot_description': robot_description_content}],
    )

    # Launch Gazebo with the custom world
    gazebo_launch = IncludeLaunchDescription(
        PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('gazebo_ros'), 'launch', 'gazebo.launch.py')),
        launch_arguments={'world': world_path}.items(),
    )

    # Spawn the humanoid robot into Gazebo
    spawn_humanoid = Node(
        package='ros_gz_sim',
        executable='create',
        arguments=['-name', 'humanoid',
                   '-topic', 'robot_description',
                   '-x', '0.0', '-y', '0.0', '-z', '1.0'], # Adjust initial pose
        output='screen',
    )

    # Controller manager and spawner nodes
    # ... (Similar to Chapter 8, but for humanoid-specific controllers)

    return LaunchDescription([
        gazebo_launch,
        robot_state_publisher_node,
        spawn_humanoid,
        # ... controller nodes ...
    ])
```

## Initial Verification

After launching your simulated environment and humanoid robot, verify the following:

*   **Robot Visibility**: Can you see your humanoid robot correctly in the simulator?
*   **Joint States**: Use `ros2 topic echo /joint_states` to confirm that joint position/velocity data is being published.
*   **Sensor Data**: Check `/camera/image_raw`, `/camera/depth/image_raw`, and `/imu/data` (or similar topics) to ensure sensor data is flowing correctly.
*   **TF Tree**: Use `ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames` to visualize the robot's kinematic tree and ensure all links and joints are correctly transformed.

This chapter has laid the groundwork by establishing our simulated home environment and integrating the humanoid robot model with ROS2. With this foundation, we can now proceed to develop the core perception and action capabilities. In the next chapter, we will focus on implementing advanced perception pipelines using Isaac ROS and visual grounding techniques.
